# Introduction
This project aims to use statistical tools to generate predictions as to which NFL players will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, should their career end right now. I take different statistics about different NFL legends and analyze which variables are the best at predicting who will make it. In other words, this project aims to answer the question: what do Hall of Famers do that non-Hall of Famers don't?

# Business Understanding
The Pro Football Hall of Fame includes players, coaches, and contributors who have "made outstanding contributions to professional football". The charter class of seventeen was selected in 1963. This project focuses on the quarterbacks, runningbacks, and wide receivers.

Enshrinees are selected by a 48-person selection committee which meets each year at the time and location of the Super Bowl. Current rules of the committee stipulate that between four and eight individuals are selected each year. Any person may nominate an individual to the hall, provided the nominee has not played or coached for at least five seasons prior to the nomination. Not including the charter class, 76 players have been inducted in their first year of eligibility.
